# Building segmentation and change detection
- It was created based on [this repo](https://github.com/rishikksh20/ResUnet) for my thesis experiment. 
- There are 2 parts:
    - Domain adaptation building segmentation based on [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07818)
    - Change detection using Siamese Network.
- Dataset:
    - Alabma dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowplus/alabama-buildings-segmentation
    - S2Looking dataset: https://github.com/S2Looking/Dataset
